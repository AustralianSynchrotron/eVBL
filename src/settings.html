<h1>Settings</h1>

<p>The settings dialog, found in the main menu, is used to configure certain parameters of the software. Under normal use at the Australian Synchrotron Education Centre there would be no need for the student to alter these values.</p>

<p>If these values need to be changed, on saving a file named 'settings.ini' will be created in the program folder. These settings will then be loaded in the future on start-up. It is also possible to edit this file directly in a text editor.</p>

<p>At any time the factory default values can be restored with the 'default' button.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
The changeable settings are:
<ul>
<li><i>mm per pixel:</i>  This value is the conversion factor for the line length measurement on the process tab. DEFAULT 0.13760</li>
<li><i>Preview video fps:</i> The frames per second refresh rate of the video capture preview window. Setting this too high will just result in the camera refreshing as fast as it can. Setting to a low value on slower machines may improve performance. DEFAULT 25</li>
<li><i>Intensity line length (pixels):</i>  The length in pixels of the intensity profile line on the process tab. DEFAULT 1024</li>
<li><i>Crop box size (pixels):</i>  The size of the square box the image will be cropped and saved to in the crop option on the processing tab. DEFAULT 1024</li> 
</ul>
